## A Survey of Advanced Assembly Language Programming Techniques on the MOS 6502 and Zilog Z80

I am the sole author of this document.

Abstract is the following:

<em>This survey documents advanced assembly language programming techniques on 8-bit home computers that address typical limitations of 8-bit microprocessors (reduced instruction set, limited processing power). The detailed techniques include the implementation of mathematical functionalities (integer multiplication and division, floating-point arithmetic, function approximation), as well as optimization techniques (precomputed tables, loop unrolling, self-modifying code, undocumented instructions). The survey is limited to the MOS 6502 and Zilog Z80, and to the 8-bit home computers based on these microprocessors (Apple II, Commodore 64, BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum). It is illustrated with examples of source code and reverse engineering of 8-bit software (built-in ROM, video games, demos) on these home computers.</em>

## A Survey of Advanced Assembly Language Programming Techniques on the MOS 6502 and Zilog Z80

Personal research paper about advanced assembly language programming techniques on 8-bit microprocessors.

The abstract is the following:

<em>This survey documents advanced assembly language programming techniques on 8-bit home computers that address typical limitations of 8-bit microprocessors (reduced instruction set, limited processing power). The detailed techniques include the implementation of mathematical functionalities (integer multiplication and division, floating-point arithmetic, function approximation), as well as optimization techniques (precomputed tables, loop unrolling, self-modifying code, undocumented instructions). The survey is limited to the MOS 6502 and Zilog Z80, and to the 8-bit home computers based on these microprocessors (Apple II, Commodore 64, BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum). It is illustrated with examples of source code and reverse engineering of 8-bit software (built-in ROM, video games, demos) on these home computers.</em>

## Text Data Augmentation: Towards better detection of spear-phishing emails

Professional research paper about text data augmentation techniques. Authors are Mehdi Regina, Maxime Meyer and myself.

The abstract is the following:

<em>Text data augmentation, i.e., the creation of new textual data from an existing text, is challenging. Indeed, augmentation transformations should take into account language complexity while being relevant to the target Natural Language Processing (NLP) task (e.g., Machine Translation, Text Classification). Initially motivated by an application of Business Email Compromise (BEC) detection, we propose a corpus and task agnostic augmentation framework used as a service to augment English texts within our company. Our proposal combines different methods, utilizing BERT language model, multi-step back-translation and heuristics. We show that our augmentation framework improves performances on several text classification tasks using publicly available models and corpora as well as on a BEC detection task. We also provide a comprehensive argumentation about the limitations of our augmentation framework.</em>
